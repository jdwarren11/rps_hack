# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This application was built during a hackathon at MakerSquare after only being in the class for a few weeks. It is a rock, paper, scissors application where users can sign-up and join an open game or create a new game to play against a random person. It uses Ruby, Foundation and Sinatra.
